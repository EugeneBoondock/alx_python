**Exception Handling in Python - Readme**

## Introduction

Exception handling is a critical aspect of Python programming that allows you to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations. This README will provide you with a concise overview of key concepts related to exception handling in Python.

## 1. Errors and Exceptions

In Python, errors can be broadly classified into two types:

### Syntax Errors
- Also known as parsing errors.
- Occur when the code violates Python's syntax rules.
- Detected during the parsing phase before execution.
- The interpreter points to the line where the error occurred and provides a brief description.

### Exceptions
- Occur during program execution.
- Represent abnormal situations, such as division by zero or accessing an undefined variable.
- Python provides a mechanism to handle these exceptions gracefully.

## 2. Handling Exceptions

Exception handling in Python involves the following elements:

### `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` Blocks
- Used to handle exceptions in Python.
- `try` block contains code that may raise an exception.
- `except` block specifies how to handle specific exceptions.
- `else` block is executed if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.
- `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

## 3. Raising Exceptions

You can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` statement. This allows you to trigger specific exceptions based on conditions in your code.

## 4. User-defined Exceptions

Python allows you to create custom exception classes by deriving them from the `Exception` class. User-defined exceptions can store specific information and provide custom error messages.

### `__init__` Method
- Special method in a class called when an object is created.
- Used for initializing the object's attributes.
- Takes `self` as the first parameter to refer to the instance being created.

## Conclusion

Exception handling is a crucial skill in Python programming. By handling errors gracefully, you can ensure your programs run smoothly and provide informative error messages when necessary. Understanding the basics of exceptions, user-defined exceptions, and the `__init__` method will empower you to write robust and reliable Python code.
